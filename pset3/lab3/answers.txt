How do you know?: for the 3 sorting algorythms I tested reversed50000 wich is the worts case and sorted50000 wich is the best case. In the reversed50000 program the sort 1 algorythm took in avarage 5.3 seconds beeing the slowest algorythm for that program,and for the sorted 50000 it took in avarage
