sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: for the 3 sorting algorythms I tested reversed50000 wich is the worts case and sorted50000 wich is the best case. In the reversed50000 program the sort 1 algorythm took in avarage 5.3 seconds beeing the slowest algorythm for that file,and for the sorted 50000 it took in avarage 0.63 seconds beeing the fastest for that file.As the bubble sort has the execution time of 0(n²) and Ω(n) sort1 uses bubblesort

sort2 uses: Merge Sort
